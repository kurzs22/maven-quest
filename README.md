# Maven install

## üí™ Challenge
Create a pom.xml file for a new Java project and build your program

https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html#how-do-i-make-my-first-maven-project

You can use the Getting started guide from maven for details.

### Create a runnable Java program
Your pom.xml should work and create a .jar file with an executable Java program. You will have to specify the main class in the manifest of the jar file and you need to add the maven-jar-plugin to modify and extend the default manifest file.

The Java program can simply print a "Hello World" message to the screen - it just has to be a runnable Java program.

### Implementation
Add information about the implementation (title, version and vendor) to the manifest file of the .jar file.

### Author and Timestamp
Add information about the author and date of creation to the manifest file of the .jar file
